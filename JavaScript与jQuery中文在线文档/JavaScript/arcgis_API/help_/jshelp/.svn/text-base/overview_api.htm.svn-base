<!--***START TEXT - DO NOT WRITE ABOVE THIS LINE***-->

<p>The ArcGIS JavaScript API is a lightweight way to embed your GIS maps and tasks 
			in Web applications. It's easy to build and deploy applications built with this 
			API. All you need is an ArcGIS Server available whose maps and tools you can 
			use in your application.</p>
		<h3>Why JavaScript?</h3>
		<p>JavaScript is a language you can use to increase the interactivity of your web 
			pages. JavaScript runs inside your browser immediately when something happens 
			on the page, such as when someone clicks a button or pans a map. You don't have 
			to wait for something to happen on the server, and the whole page does not 
			blink or refresh. For this reason, JavaScript is an excellent choice for 
			embedding maps in your applications.</p>
		<p>You don't have to download or install anything in order to program with 
			JavaScript. All web browsers know how to interpret it. In many cases, the JavaScript code can be embedded directly into the HTML page.</p>
		<p>JavaScript is accessible to beginning programmers. Even if you haven't 
			programmed with JavaScript before, you can learn how to build JavaScript 
			applications by cutting and pasting example code into your HTML pages. In many 
			cases, the example may be just what you need with only minor adjustments.</p>
		<h3>What can you do with the ArcGIS JavaScript API?</h3>
		<p>You can use the ArcGIS JavaScript API to bring maps and tasks from ArcGIS Server 
			into your web applications. For example, you can:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Display an interactive map of your own data</li>
			<li>
				Execute a GIS model on the server and display the results</li>
			<li>
				Display your data on an ArcGIS Online base map</li>
			<li>
				Search for features or attributes in your GIS data and display the results</li>
			<li>
				Search for addresses and display the results</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You can use the ArcGIS JavaScript API to access information from several 
			different servers in one application. One common reason you might do this is to 
			display some of your own information on top of a base map from ArcGIS Online or 
			from other web sources. In another scenario, you might use a model on one 
			server and display the results on a map from a different server. This 
			combination of information from multiple web sources is sometimes called a 
			"mashup".</p>
		<p>Remember that you don't need to have ArcGIS Server installed on your machine in 
			order to program with the ArcGIS JavaScript API. You just need to have an 
			ArcGIS Server available that you can access through a URL. ESRI has provided 
			several sample servers that you can use as you practice writing JavaScript 
			applications. The samples in this help system use the sample servers.</p>
		<h3>What does the ArcGIS JavaScript API include?</h3>
		<p>The ArcGIS JavaScript API provides the following resources for you to use in 
			your web applications</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Maps</b> - The API supports display of both dynamic and cached (tiled) map 
				services from ArcGIS Server. With the ArcGIS JavaScript API, you can display 
				maps in any projection.</li>
			<li>
				<b>Graphics</b> - You can enhance your web applications by allowing users to 
				draw graphics or by providing informational popup windows when the user clicks 
				or hovers the mouse over a graphics feature on the map.</li>
			<li>
				<b>Tasks</b> - The API includes classes and methods for common GIS tasks:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Querying</li>
					<li>
						Finding addresses</li>
					<li>
						Finding attributes</li>
					<li>
						Identifying features</li>
					<li>
						Geoprocessing</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Access to Dojo and other libraries</b> - The ArcGIS JavaScript API is built 
				on the <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/" target="_blank">Dojo JavaScript Toolkit</a>, providing you access to dijits (Dojo widgets) 
				and other JavaScript tools. You can also integrate other libraries in your 
				applications, such as the Google Chart API.</li></ul>
		<h3>Getting Help</h3>
		<p>This help system includes easy to advanced walkthroughs that explain how to use 
			the ArcGIS JavaScript API. If you're new to JavaScript programming, start with 
			the walkthroughs in the Getting Started section. If you already have some 
			JavaScript experience, you can start by browsing the Examples or the API 
			Reference.</p>

		<h3>Other JavaScript APIs</h3>
		<p>ESRI provides two other ways to embed ArcGIS Server functionality in your web 
			pages with JavaScript:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="http://resources.esri.com/arcgisserver/apis/javascript/gmaps/index.cfm?fa=home" target="_blank">
					The ArcGIS JavaScript Extension for the Google Maps API</a> gives you a way 
				to work with your GIS services in the framework of Google Maps and other Google 
				APIs.</li>
			<li>
				<a href="http://resources.esri.com/arcgisserver/apis/javascript/ve/index.cfm?fa=home" target="_blank">
					The ArcGIS JavaScript Extension for Virtual Earth</a> lets you access your 
				GIS resources from a Microsoft Virtual Earth control in 2D or 3D.</li>
		</ul>
