<p>To do geoprocessing in the ArcGIS JavaScript API, you'll use the <A href="../jsapi/geoprocessor.htm">esri.tasks.Geoprocessor</A> class. The constructor for this class requires the URL of the geoprocessing task you are going to run. You can use the <A href="ags_rest.htm">Services Directory</A> to discover the URL.</p>
<p>The Services Directory contains links for all the available services. The
			image below shows an example of what you see when you click a link for a
			geoprocessing service.</p>
		<IMG alt="The ESRI_Elevation_World page in the Services Directory" src="images/gp_sd_1.png"/>
		<p>The breadcrumbs below the title bar show that this is the geoprocessing service <a href="http://sampleserver1.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Elevation/ESRI_Elevation_World/GPServer"
				target="_blank">ESRI_Elevation_World</a> in the folder Elevation. The
			address bar shows that this service is running on the ESRI sample server
			sampleserver1.arcgisonline.com. In the service there is one task, Viewshed,
			which is a geoprocessing model available on the server. A geoprocessing service
			can have multiple tasks available, because the server administrator publishes
			the service from a toolbox that can hold many models.</p>
		<p>Here's what you see if you follow the link to the <a href="http://sampleserver1.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Elevation/ESRI_Elevation_World/GPServer/Viewshed"
				target="_blank">Viewshed</a> task:</p>
		<IMG alt="The Viewshed task in the Services Directory" src="images/gp_sd_2.png"/>
		<p>The URL from this page is what you should copy and paste in your code when you create
			the Geoprocessor:</p>
		<pre>gp = new esri.tasks.Geoprocessor("http://sampleserver1.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/
        Elevation/ESRI_Elevation_World/GPServer/Viewshed");</pre>
