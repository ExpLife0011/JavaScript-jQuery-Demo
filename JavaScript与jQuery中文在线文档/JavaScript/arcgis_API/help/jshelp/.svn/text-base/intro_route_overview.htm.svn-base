			<p>The ArcGIS JavaScript API's <a href="../jsapi/routetask.htm">RouteTask</a> allows 
				you to find routes between two or more locations and optionally get driving 
				directions. The RouteTask uses ArcGIS Server network analysis services to 
				calculate routes. Network analysis services allow you to solve simple routing 
				problems as well as complex ones that take into account multiple stops, 
				barriers, and time windows.</p>
			<p><b>Note: </b>The ability to expose network analysis services through REST (and 
				therefore the ArcGIS JavaScript API) begins at ArcGIS Server version 9.3.1. 
				Network analysis services published from prior versions of ArcGIS Server cannot 
				be consumed using the ArcGIS JavaScript API.</p>
			<h3>How do I create a network analysis service?</h3>
			<p>To get a network analysis service, you'll need to do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Create an ArcMap document (MXD) and add a network analysis layer that 
					references a network dataset.</li>
				<li>
					Publish that map document to ArcGIS Server as a map service.</li>
				<li>
					Enable the Network Analysis capability on the map service.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The above steps show that a network analysis service really originates from a 
				map service and a map document. It's a good practice for performance to 
				maintain the network analysis service separate from other map services in your 
				Web application. In other words, don't put your network analysis layer in the 
				map that will primarily be used for display.</p>
			<p>If you're new to ESRI network analysis, the following reading will give you some 
				more background on Network Analyst and network analysis services:</p>

			<h3>What can the RouteTask do?</h3>
			<p>The RouteTask helps you solve a routing problem, meaning that it finds a 
				least-cost path between multiple locations that lie on a network. Cost is 
				calculated based on an impedance attribute which you define in a <a href="http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.3/index.cfm?TopicName=What_is_a_network_dataset%3F"
					target="_blank">network dataset</a>. Impedance can be time or distance, or 
				even a more abstract variable such as "scenic value".</p>
			<p>The RouteTask can help you find the best sequence of stops. For example, if the 
				cost of traveling from Stop A to Stop B is higher than the opposite direction 
				because of one-way streets, you will get a solution where Stop B is visited 
				first. Also, if you have multiple stops that can be visited in any order, the 
				RouteTask will find the most efficient sequence. You can optionally choose to 
				keep the first or last stop fixed in case the route needs to start or end at a 
				certain point.</p>
			<p>The RouteTask can also work with time windows, which are designated intervals of 
				time in which stops must be made (for example 3:00 - 4:00 AM for Stop A). If 
				your stops have time windows defined, the RouteTask will find a sequence of 
				stops where the time windows are met and the overall cost is minimized. 
				Additionally, the RouteTask can consider barriers which block particular road 
				segments, as well as restrictions of use such as one-way streets.</p>
			<p>The RouteTask can return a route with its geometry, cost, turn-by-turn 
				directions, and other accumulated values that you specify such as "walk time".</p>
