			<p>The following are new features in version 1.5 of the ArcGIS JavaScript API.</p>
			<p><b>Note:</b> The ArcGIS JavaScript Extension for the Google Maps API and the 
				ArcGIS JavaScript Extension for Microsoft Virtual Earth have no changes at 
				version 1.5.</p>
			<H4 class="dtH4">Support for Firefox 3.5</H4>
			<p>Version 1.5 includes support for Firefox 3.5. Previous versions of the ArcGIS 
				JavaScript API had problems showing picture marker symbols in Firefox 3.5.</p>
			<H4 class="dtH4">Support for Dojo 1.3.2</H4>
			<p>When you reference the ArcGIS JavaScript API version 1.5, you get access to Dojo 
				1.3.2.</p>
			<p>See the <a href="http://bugs.dojotoolkit.org/milestone/1.3.2" target="_blank">Dojo 
					Milestone 1.3.2 page</a> for a list of specific issues fixed between Dojo 
				1.3.1 and 1.3.2. These are changes that will take effect when you upgrade from 
				version 1.4 to 1.5 of the ArcGIS JavaScript API.</p>
			<p>If you're upgrading from version 1.3 of the ArcGIS JavaScript API or earlier, 
				also see the <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/book/dojo-1-3-release-notes" target="_blank">
					Dojo 1.3 Release Notes</a>.</p>
			<H4 class="dtH4">Ability to change mouse cursor type</H4>
			<p>In version 1.5 you can change the default mouse cursor behavior and types. The 
				Map already has some built-in cursor changes such as switching to the the 
				four-headed arrow "move" cursor during a pan. You can add other cursor changes 
				by calling <i>Map.setMapCursor()</i> in response to map events. For example, if 
				you made a custom tool for identifying or learning about map features, you 
				might change to the question mark "help" cursor upon activation of the tool. 
				When the user finishes with the tool, you can call setMapCursor again to return 
				to the original cursor.</p>
			<p>When you call setMapCursor, you need to supply the cursor type. A list of 
				standard CSS cursor values is available <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/ui.html#cursor-props" target="_blank">
					here</a>. Web browsers have built-in support for various cursors, many of 
				which are common to all browsers. Use caution when using cursors that are not 
				supported by all browsers.</p>
			<H4 class="dtH4">Ability to access the JavaScript API through HTTPS</H4>
			<p>Beginning at version 1.5, you can use "https" in the URLs that you use to 
				reference the ArcGIS JavaScript API. This means that your page will access the 
				ArcGIS JavaScript API through an encrypted connection. This can be useful if 
				your page already uses HTTPS and you don't want your users to see a message 
				from the browser indicating that some elements in the page are not secure. 
				Referencing the ArcGIS JavaScript API through HTTPS does not require changes to 
				your coding syntax or logic.</p>
			<H4 class="dtH4">Bug fixes</H4>
			<p>In addition to the enhancements above, version 1.5 contains various bug fixes to 
				improve the stability and performance of the ArcGIS JavaScript API. Two 
				important fixes are:
				<ul>
					<li>
					In some scenarios, the click event on the zoom slider did not get released, 
					causing the cursor to seem "stuck" to the slider. (NIM043117)
					<li>
						If you hid a graphic, panned the graphic off the map, then partially panned the 
						graphic back onto the map, the graphic would become visibile.</li>
				</ul>
