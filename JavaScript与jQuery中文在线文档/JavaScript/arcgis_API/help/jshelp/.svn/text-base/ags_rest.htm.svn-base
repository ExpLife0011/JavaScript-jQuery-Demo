<p>The Services Directory can help you discover information about services 
			available on a particular server. A service represents a local GIS resource 
			whose functionality has been made available on the server to a wider audience. 
			For example, an ArcGIS Server administrator can publish an ArcMap document 
			(.mxd) as a map service. Developers and clients can display the map service and 
			query its contents.</p>
		<p>
			The Services Directory is available as part of the REST services infrastructure 
			available with ArcGIS Server 9.3 installations. It enables you to list the 
			services available, including <a href="ags_security.htm">secured services</a> when 
			you provide a proper login. For each service, a set of general properties are 
			displayed. For map services, these properties include the spatial extent, 
			spatial reference (coordinate system) and supported operations. Layers are also 
			listed, with links to details about layers, which includes layer fields and 
			extent. The Services Directory can execute simple queries on layers.</p>
		<p>The Services Directory is also useful for finding information about non-map 
			service types. For example, you can use the Services Directory to determine the 
			required address format for a geocode service, or the necessary model inputs 
			for a geoprocessing service.</p>
		<h4>Opening the Services Directory
		</h4>
		<p>
			To open the Services Directory for an ArcGIS Server, you must know the URL of 
			the server instance. In a typical installation of ArcGIS Server, the instance 
			is installed in the web server's root directory as "arcgis". The Services 
			Directory is in the "rest" folder inside the instance. For example, if the 
			server is at www.example.com, the Services Directory would typically be at <em>http://www.example.com/arcgis/rest/services</em>. 
			Contact the administrator of the ArcGIS Server system if you are uncertain 
			about the server URL or ArcGIS instance.</p>
		<h4>
			Getting information about a service in Services Directory</h4>
		<p>
			You may use the Services Directory to obtain information you need to use a 
			service with the ArcGIS JavaScript API. You can copy a service's URL from your 
			browser's address bar and paste it in the appropriate place in your code. For 
			example, a service in the example server cited above might have a URL of <em>http://www.example.com/arcgis/rest/services/ExampleService/MapServer</em>. 
			This URL is required in the constructor for a map service. Notice the server 
			type (MapServer) at the end of the URL, which ensures that the service will 
			have a unique URL if there is a service of a different type with the same name.</p>
		<p>
			You can get other useful information from the Services Directory beyond the 
			service's URL. For example, to identify features within particular layers, you 
			need to supply the IDs of the layers (see the walk-through <a href="intro_querytask.htm">
				Using QueryTask, Query, and FeatureSet</a>). These IDs are listed with the 
			Layers list in a map service's properties page in the Services Directory. If 
			you need names of attribute fields to specify the information to return in a 
			query, you can navigate to the layer's properties to find a list of fields.</p>
		<p>
			Services and folders may be secured so that only authorized users may access 
			them. If a service or folder does not appear as expected, it may require a 
			login. If the server administrator has provided a username and password to you, 
			click the Login link in the Services Directory and log in to see services 
			permitted to you. For more information, see <a href="ags_security.htm">Working with 
				secure ArcGIS services</a>.</p>
		<h4>
			About the REST API</h4>
		<p>
			The <a href="http://resources.esri.com/help/9.3/arcgisserver/apis/rest/index.html" target="_blank">
				ArcGIS Server REST API</a> provides a relatively simple way to use services 
			provided by ArcGIS Server. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer" target="_blank">
				REST</a> enables use of web resources by encapsulating information in the 
			URL and query string of the request. It has become popular when combined with 
			the technology known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29" target="_blank">
				AJAX</a> for creating dynamic client-side web applications.</p>
		<p>
			ArcGIS Server includes a REST API for accessing services. The REST API supports 
			most of the functionality available in the ArcGIS Server SOAP API, which is 
			used in the server-side Web Application Developer Framework (ADF) packages for 
			ASP.NET and Java. The difference is that the REST API enables creation of 
			applications that are strictly client-side. Most REST API-based applications 
			are focused, simple applications of ArcGIS Server technology. The ArcGIS 
			JavaScript API uses the REST API to communicate with services in ArcGIS Server. 
			The REST API is used in other APIs available with ArcGIS Server, including the <a href="http://resources.esri.com/arcgisserver/apis/javascript/ve/index.cfm?fa=home"
				target="_blank">ArcGIS Server JavaScript Extension for Virtual Earth</a> and 
			the <a href="http://resources.esri.com/arcgisserver/apis/javascript/gmaps/index.cfm?fa=home"
				target="_blank">ArcGIS JavaScript Extension for the Google Maps API</a>.</p>
